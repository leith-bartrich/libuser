FIE Contributor License Agreement 1.0
based on (but heavily modified from) the
Perl Contributor License Agreement 1.0

In order to document the non-exclusive intellectual property
license granted for contributions to this code base, FIE LLC obtains a
Contributor License Agreement ("CLA"), signed by each Contributor.  Under the
CLA the contributor retains ownership of each Contribution, and remains free to
use each contribution independently of FIE LLC and this code base, for other purposes.

Please complete and send a signed CLA to: 

  brad@fie.us

Please include the text "CLA SUBMISSION" in the subject of the email.

The CLA will be encrypted and commited to the project's top level repository before any contributions are
merged into the official code base.

The private encryption key will be held by FIE LLC and you willbe provided a copy as well.
This protects the personal information of contributors to the project but allows an open
and verifiable record of the existence of the CLA and allows it to be independently
verified and decrypted by both parties.

Please read this agreement carefully before signing it, and keep a copy for
your records.

1.  Definitions.

The "Work" means an existing body of code or documentation that is part of any
of the projects or products owned or managed by FIE LLC.

"Contribution" means any work of authorship, including any modifications or
additions to the Work, that is Submitted by you for inclusion in the Work.
"Submitted" means provided to the project, or its representatives, by any form
of electronic, verbal, or written communication, for instance, posting to
electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, or issue tracking
systems that are used for building, discussing, and improving the Work.  No
communication that is conspicuously marked in writing by you as "Not a
Contribution" will be considered to be a Contribution.

"Users" means recipients of the Work distributed by the FIE LLC, or
distributed by others in accordance with FIE LLC's requirements.

"You" means the individual, or other party, that is making this CLA with FIE LLC.
For parties other than individuals, "you" includes all of the
organizational affiliates of the party signing this CLA.  An "organizational
affiliate" means each party that controls, is controlled by, or under common
control with, the party signing this CLA. 


2.  Acceptance. 	You accept and agree to the terms and conditions of
this CLA for your present and future Contributions, and for your Contributions
made prior to signing this CLA.  Your prior contributions subject to this CLA
include, but are not limited to, the Contributions listed on Schedule 1.


3. FIE LLC Obligations. 	Except for the license
granted under this CLA, you reserve all rights in your Contributions.


4.  License.

4.1  Subject to this CLA, you grant to the Foundation, and to the Users, a
perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, free-of-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
license under all intellectual property rights (excluding patent and trademark,
but including copyright) to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contributions, and
derivative works. 

4.2  You also grant to FIE LLC, and to the Users, a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, free-of-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as
specified in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to
sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution. This license
applies only to those patent claims licensable by you (including without
limitation any patent claims you may acquire in the future) that are
necessarily infringed by your Contribution(s) alone, or by the combination of
your Contribution(s) with the Work or with the subsequent contributions of
anyone else.  If any party institutes patent litigation against you or any
other party (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes
direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
that party based on the rights you have granted to the Foundation under this
CLA shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.


5.  Representations.

5.1  You represent that you are legally entitled to grant this license. If your
employer(s) has rights to intellectual property created by you which include
your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make
Contributions on behalf of that employer, or that your employer has waived such
rights for your Contributions to FIE LLC, or that your employer has
signed a separate CLA with FIE LLC.  If you have employees, you also
represent that any employee making a Contribution on your behalf is fully
authorized to do so, and that you have sufficient rights in the employee's
Contribution to grant this license.

5.2  You also represent that each of your Contributions is your original
creation, and that to the best of your knowledge, includes complete details of
any third-party license or other restriction, for instance, related patents and
trademarks associated with it.

5.3  If you become aware of any facts or circumstances that would make your
representation under this CLA inaccurate in any respect, you will notify FIE LLC
promptly.


6.  Support.	You are not expected to provide support for your Contributions,
unless you want to do so.  Whether or not you charge a fee for support is up to
you.  


7.  Warranty Disclaimer.	To the extent permitted by law, you provide
your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES
OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
